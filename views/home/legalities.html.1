  <h2 class="text-muted">Terms of Use</h2>
  <p>
    You are welcome to make any legal use of this site and its code that you like. However, you do so at your own risk. 
    Note that I am not a professional developer but a hobbyist (and a rookie, at that). Don’t assume I’ve done things 
    properly or even securely. I disclaim all liability for use of this site and its code. 
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-muted">Privacy “Policy”</h2>
  <p>
    I won’t do anything with any personal information you send to the site’s databases. Note also that you don’t 
    have to use real information to register and post articles or comments; fake names and email addresses will work fine.
  </p>
  <p>
    I expect to periodically delete all user created accounts and content, either manually or (if I can figure how) 
    programmatically.
